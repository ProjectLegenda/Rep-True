Pre-requisite:

    Install original python3.6.5+ from https://www.python.org
 
    NOTE:Please don't install anaconda or ipython for this tools because original python depend on variable PYTHONPATH when searching for user defined site packages 
    But others may not, but if you are familiar with all distribution of python, you can install other distribution and hack launch shell script yourself

    Install Standard site-package from PyPI and make sure whenever you launch python process and packages below are accessible and importable without changing sys.path explicitly 

    pandas
    jieba
    numpy
    pyhive
    sqlalchemy
    thrift
    Cython

    export PATH and let shell know where to find your python3 binary
    
    example: 
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
 

Installing smarttool project 

    tar -xf Smarttool.tar
    cd Smarttool 
    export SMARTTOOL_HOME=`pwd`
    
    if you want to refer the smart tool shell script you can add $SMARTTOOL_HOME/bin into your path like 
    export PATH=$PATH:$SMARTTOOL_HOME/bin
    

Launching smarttool 
  
    $SMARTTOOL_HOME/bin/smarttool.sh input.json output.json
    ## $1 for smarttool.sh is input json $2 for smarttool.sh is output json file


Caveats: 
    The site package is based on Cython and possibly need to be re-compiled if the enviorment changed 
    Enviorment variable SMARTTOOL_HOME must be set
    If the output json already exists, error will be raised.
